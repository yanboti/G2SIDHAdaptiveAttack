# G2SIDHAdaptiveAttack
An implementation of the adaptive attack on G2SIDH as presented in the paper https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/990.

To use the file, run either rank2.m or rank3.m for the rank 2 or rank 3 cases.
This implementation assumes that Alice is using a symplectic basis, and recovers the secret scalars used.
